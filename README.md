## Overview

I've been helping my friend Kate compile data from New York City's bikesharing program in an attempt to show investors that the program can be replicated in Des Moines, IA. We've been using the visualization program Tableau to showcase the data in easily digestible ways. Our purpose has been to create simple, well-defined visualizations that our investors can read to conclude that yes, it's entirely possible to create profitable bikesharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

The first page of our story [(found here!)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.rutledge/viz/arChallenge14/NYCBikesharingData?publish=yes) illustrates just how popular bikesharing is during the month of August in NYC.
