# bikesharing



## Overview

I've been helping my friend Kate compile data from New York City's bikesharing program in an attempt to show investors that the program can be replicated in Des Moines, IA. We've been using the visualization program Tableau to showcase the data in easily digestible ways. Our purpose has been to create simple, well-defined visualizations that our investors can read to conclude that yes, it's entirely possible to create profitable bikesharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

The first page of our story [(found here!)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.rutledge/viz/arChallenge14/NYCBikesharingData?publish=yes) illustrates just how popular bikesharing is during the month of August in NYC. 

Our first visualization is simple, stating the exact number of rides during the month at 2,344,224. 

Our second illustrates the checkout times for all users, showing the vast majority of trips fall under a half hour of usage. Below this image, our checkout times are broken down by gender, showing a marked increase in usage by men over women - but no major difference in usage times. It does appear that men take the bikes out for slightly longer than women, but this might simply be a function of more men riding than women. 

Finally, the last visualization on the page shows utilization by hour of the day, illustrating a healthy usage during all daylight hours, with peaks occuring during the mornings and evenings.


The second page of our story delves a little deeper into usage, breaking down rides into days of the week. 

Our first visualization allows us to drill-down into the weekday trips per hour by the gender of the rider. We can see that the intensity of usage for each gender is roughly the same -- here I mean we see the same usage intensities increasing on the same hours of the same days -- but we simply have *more* women using than unknown genders, and *more* men than women. For example, 8AM on Thursday is a heavy usage time, as well as 6PM on Thursday, across all gender types. 

These usage trends are aggregated for all genders in the chart below, "Weekday Trips per Hour."

Finally, in the "User Trips by Gender by Weekday," we get to see a gender/weekday breakdown by User Type, Customer vs. Subscriber. 

## Summary

Overall, our results show that in NYC, the bikesharing program is enormously popular in the month of August, with especially heavy use among men. It has consistent use from morning until evening, and hits two peaks every morning and evening. Weekend hours, as one would expect, have more consistent usage throughout the day, as opposed to heavily concentrated peak AM/PM times. Subscriber User Types are the types of users most desired, as these users are the most likely to utilize the service most often. Finally, the program should be structred to expect the majority of trips to fall under 30 minutes (and likely, under 20). 

For additional exploration, it would be useful to look at the length of trips during August. A visualization of length of trips by user would be excellent, as well as a length of trips by user by gender. For planning purposes, I think it would also be appropriate to look at a length of trips by user gender by day as well, so we could have an expectation of how rides differ on weekends. We already know the weekends demand a more consistent usage throughout the day, but do their rides demand a longer duration or a longer distance as well, and would they require additional planning?
