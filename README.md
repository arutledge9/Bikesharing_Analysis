## Overview

I've been helping my friend Kate compile data from New York City's bikesharing program in an attempt to show investors that the program can be replicated in Des Moines, IA. We've been using the visualization program Tableau to showcase the data in easily digestible ways. Our purpose has been to create simple, well-defined visualizations that our investors can read to conclude that yes, it's entirely possible to create profitable bikesharing program in Des Moines. 

## Results

The first page of our story [(found here!)](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/andy.rutledge/viz/arChallenge14/NYCBikesharingData?publish=yes) illustrates just how popular bikesharing is during the month of August in NYC. 

Our first visualization is simple, stating the exact number of rides during the month at 2,344,224. 

Our second illustrates the checkout times for all users, showing the vast majority of trips fall under a half hour of usage. Below this image, our checkout times are broken down by gender, showing a marked increase in usage by men over women - but no major difference in usage times. It does appear that men take the bikes out for slightly longer than women, but this might simply be a function of more men riding than women. 

Finally, the last visualization on the page shows utilization by hour of the day, illustrating a healthy usage during all daylight hours, with peaks occuring during the mornings and evenings.


The second page of our story delves a little deeper into usage, breaking down rides into days of the week.
